##### Alen Ray's Personal Website
---------------------------------------

If you've come across this, it's either you know me *or* you got a link from somewhere/someone! Anyways, welcome! Some things may be messy, but hey, I'm proud of this mess :)

###### Resources
As this is my first *real* project -- both for class and for myself -- I, of course, had to look some things up! The following are some of the resources that I have used/taken inspiration from when developing this personal website. I will do my best to keep this as up-to-date as possible!
